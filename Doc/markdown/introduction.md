## RFUniverse: A Multiphysics Simulation Platform for Embodied AI

### [HomePage](https://sites.google.com/view/rfuniverse) | [Documentation](https://mvig-robotflow.github.io/pyrfuniverse/) | [Python](https://github.com/mvig-robotflow/pyrfuniverse) | [Unity](https://github.com/mvig-robotflow/rfuniverse) | [Paper](#introduction) | [Forum](https://forum.robotflow.ai/c/simulation/rfuniverse/5)

RFUniverse is a novel simulation environment that can not only compute rigid and multi-body dynamics, but also multiphysics coupling effects commonly observed in daily life, such as air-solid interaction, fluid-solid interaction, and heat transfer. `pyrfuniverse` is a python package where users can get data from `RFUniverse` and operate objects in simulation. With `pyrfuniverse`, users can combine `RFUniverse` with multiple algorithms and data processing functions, which makes `RFUniverse` a great tool in embodied AI.

To help users get familiar with RFUniverse, we write this documentation and hope researchers who are interested in robotics and simulation can use RFUniverse to help their research and make RFUniverse a greater tool!

In introduction part, we also prepare other contents including [Get Started](get_started_1), [Understanding pyrfuniverse](understanding_pyrfuniverse_1) and [Advanced Usage Guides](advanced_usage_guides). We strongly recommend users go through these pages before proceeding.

## Tutorials

In tutorial part, we use 4 cases to teach users how to build an RL environment using `Unity` and `pyrfuniverse` from scratch. The 4 cases include rigid and multi-body dynamics, air-solid interaction, fluid-solid interaction as well as physics-based cutting. Meanwhile, all these environments are corresponding to the experiments in paper. 

For users who are not familiar with Unity Editor, we also provide a 'Quick Start' option at the beginning where users can use our pre-build package directly.

## Examples

In examples part, we provide several documented examples where users can test their installation, try our APIs, get familiar with `pyrfuniverse` API and usages, as well as extend their functions.

## API Reference

In API Reference part, we provide the documentation of most important and most frequently used classes and functions in `pyrfuniverse`. Users can refer to them if our examples or tutorials are not enough.

## Communication channels
